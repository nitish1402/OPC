<p> 
    Abhikalpan the tech-fest of IIITDMJ brings an amazing competition</br>
    of breaking love triangles. So the coordinators of the event </br>
    invite all triples from all over the world.<br>
 
    </br>
    A triple can have 2 boys and 1 girl or 2 girls and 1 boy =D.
    So two break this triangle they have given a task. According to the
    task two competitors 2 girls or 2 boys from triples have to shoot 
    the balls arranged in a row(there can be as many as possible balls in a row).
    </br>
    According to the rule one contestant starts shooting from leftmost to right 
    one after another and the other contestant starts shooting from rightmost
    to left one after another.
    </br>
    So event was going well for each triples , but as love triangles are very 
    complicated a strange thing happened during the contest ,it happened so that 
    both of the contestant from each triples shot one and the same ball at some
    time.
    </br>
    At first they are fighting for a boy or girl but now they are fighting for
    why they have shot the same ball ,they became furious and forgot the count
    of the the no. of balls initially at the row, But anyhow they remembered
    the count of the balls which they have shot.
    </br>
    To get the winner each of the contestant among two now want to know 
    how many balls are not shot by the other contestant.
